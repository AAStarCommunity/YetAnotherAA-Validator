 * @title IFraudProofVerifier
 * @notice The seam BLSAggregator.queueGuardianSlash (SuperPaymaster BLSAggregator ≥ 4.7.0, ABI
 *         frozen through 4.11.0) plugs into. SP trusts only an owner-set verifier and never judges
 *         fraud itself: it slashes the addresses in `guiltyGuardians` iff `verify(...)` returns true.
 *         Correctness of "are these guardians truly guilty" is entirely the verifier's job (CC-89 A').
 *
 * @dev    CC-115 B1 — 4-parameter, DOMAIN-BOUND ABI. The selector is
 *         `verify(bytes32,uint256,address[],bytes)` == 0x61077735 (unchanged since SP 4.7.0; the
 *         4.9.0 bump is the aggregator's own ABI, not this seam's). SP invokes it as
 *
 *             verify(fraudProofDigest(fraudProofId, guiltyGuardians), fraudProofId,
 *                    guiltyGuardians, fraudProof)
 *
 *         where `fraudProofDigest` binds (DOMAIN_NAME, block.chainid, aggregator, Registry) via the
 *         BLS-consensus domain separator plus the fraud-proof path tag, `fraudProofId` and
 *         `guiltyGuardians`. A conformant verifier MUST bind `domainDigest` INTO its accept/reject
 *         decision (recompute the canonical digest and require byte equality) — merely accepting the
 *         argument and ignoring it re-opens, from the DVT side, exactly the cross-contract / cross-chain
 *         / cross-Registry replay the aggregator's domain separation closed. A comment is not a gate;
 *         SP's `FraudProofVerifierConformance` fixture is.
 *
 * @dev    `view` — the fraud proof must reduce to on-chain-checkable facts (see
 *         docs/design/guardian-collusion-slash.md §4b). MUST fail-closed: any malformed input,
 *         wrong domain, missing/mismatched signer-set commitment, non-canonical accusation, or
 *         unproven fraud returns `false` (never revert on a rejected proof — a revert would let the
 *         caller distinguish rejection reasons and grief the permissionless entry).
