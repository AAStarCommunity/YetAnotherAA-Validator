/**
 * @title FraudProofVerifierConformance
 * @notice CC-48 round-3 MEDIUM-2: the test fixture that decides whether a DVT-supplied
 *         fraud-proof verifier really binds `domainDigest`, rather than merely accepting
 *         it as an argument.
 *
 * @dev The problem this exists for. `IFraudProofVerifier.verify` takes `domainDigest`
 *      first and the NatSpec says verifiers MUST bind it — but a verifier is an external
 *      contract, and ignoring a parameter has no on-chain consequence. A verifier that
 *      only looks at (fraudProofId, guiltyGuardians, fraudProof) accepts a proof built
 *      for a DIFFERENT aggregator or chain, which re-opens from the DVT side exactly the
 *      cross-contract replay the aggregator's domain separation closed. A comment is not
 *      a gate; this is.
 *
 *      Usage in the DVT repo (repo:dvt owns the verifier; SP owns this fixture):
 *
 *          import {FraudProofVerifierConformance as Conformance}
 *              from "<superpaymaster>/contracts/test/helpers/FraudProofVerifierConformance.sol";
 *
 *          function test_VerifierIsDomainBound() public {
 *              Conformance.assertDomainBound(
 *                  address(myVerifier),
 *                  address(aggregatorA),   // the aggregator the proof was built for
 *                  address(aggregatorB),   // any other aggregator: same chain is enough
 *                  fraudProofId,
 *                  guiltyGuardians,
 *                  fraudProofBytes
 *              );
 *          }
 *
 *          function test_VerifierIsSetBound() public {
 *              Conformance.assertSetBound(
 *                  address(myVerifier),
 *                  address(aggregatorA),   // digests are recomputed per perturbed set
 *                  fraudProofId,
 *                  guiltyGuardians,        // the EXACT set the evidence commits to (>= 2)
 *                  fraudProofBytes
 *              );
 *          }
 *
 *      `aggregatorB` may be a second deployment on the SAME chain with the SAME Registry
 *      and the SAME validator keys — that is the hardest case and the one that actually
 *      happened (an experiment stack's proofs replaying onto production). If a verifier
 *      passes with only a different chainid, it has not been tested.
 *
 *      The three assertions:
 *        1. ACCEPTS the digest it was built for   (no false negatives — a verifier that
 *           rejects everything would trivially "pass" a replay test)
 *        2. REJECTS another aggregator's digest for the same (id, guardians, proof)
 *        3. REJECTS an arbitrary unrelated digest (catches "compares to a constant")
 *
 *      CC-48 round-5 MEDIUM-1 — `assertDomainBound` IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN. Domain
 *      binding says nothing about WHICH guardians a proof covers, so a verifier that
 *      recomputes the digest from the (id, guardians) it was handed passes all three
 *      assertions above while happily accepting a strict SUBSET of the guilty set.
 *      Because `fraudProofId` is single-use for ever, that is directly exploitable —
 *      see `assertSetBound` below. BOTH assertions are release gates; running only
 *      this one is the failure mode this paragraph exists to prevent.
