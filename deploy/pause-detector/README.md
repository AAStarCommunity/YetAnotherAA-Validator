# Pause detector (rc.8)

For rc.8, pausing an understaked operator is **detect, then act by hand** (DSR):
keeper α is parked, and the standalone D2 pause job (`deploy/pause-job`) is
retired. This detector watches, and a person pauses with the exact command it
sends.

It is D2's read path with every send path removed. It holds **no key**. There is
no keystore, no signer, and no signing or broadcast code. Its JSON-RPC client
refuses every method outside six read-only ones before the request leaves the
process. `check-pause-detector.mjs` fails CI if any signing, broadcast, key or
subprocess call appears in the detector or in anything it imports. Its own
control cells show the scan catching such calls.

## What one round does (hourly, launchd)

1. **Inventory.** It extends the operator list from the SP proxy's
   `OperatorConfigured` logs, over finalized ranges only. The cursor moves past
   a range only after that range's `getLogs` succeeded; a failed range is
   retried next round, never skipped.
2. **One block.** It pins B, the latest block, by hash. Every read below is at B
   (EIP-1898, `requireCanonical`).
3. **Identity at B.**
   - `SuperPaymaster.REGISTRY()` is the configured Registry.
   - The EIP-1967 implementation slot of **both** proxies holds the configured
     implementation.
   - The SP proxy, its implementation, the Registry proxy and its implementation
     all hash to their configured code hashes. SP and the Registry are both
     ERC-1967 proxies with the same proxy bytecode, so a proxy's code hash alone
     identifies nothing.
4. **Recent operators.** Operators configured after the cursor, up to B, are
   read this round too. They are not persisted until finalized.
5. **Each operator at B.**
   - It reads `operators(op).{isConfigured, isPaused}` and the three Registry
     reads of `SuperPaymasterStorage._hasEffectiveSuperStake`:
     `hasRole(ROLE_PAYMASTER_SUPER, op)`,
     `getRoleConfig(ROLE_PAYMASTER_SUPER).minStake` and
     `getEffectiveStake(op, ROLE_PAYMASTER_SUPER)`. The operator is understaked
     when it is configured and does not hold the role with
     `effective >= minStake`.
   - It cross-checks with an `eth_call` of `pauseUnderstakedOperator(op)` from
     the zero address. The function is permissionless; an eth_call broadcasts
     nothing. If the reads and SP's own check disagree, the result is
     **unknown**.
6. **Canonical check.** B is re-checked canonical after every read. If it left
   the chain, the whole round is unknown.

- **"unknown" is never "clear".** `status.json.clear` is true only when the
  identity was confirmed at a canonical B, every read succeeded, and no operator
  is actionable or unknown.
- **When the identity is not confirmed, no PAUSE NEEDED is sent.** The identity
  alert is sent instead, because the detector may be reading the wrong contract.
- **Repeats.** An alert repeats every `realertMinutes` while it holds.
- **Resolution.** A `resolved:` line is sent once a later round sees the
  condition gone. For an operator, that requires the operator to be read at a
  canonical B with the identity confirmed.
- **No all-clear messages.** The trigger evidence is `status.json`, which
  preflight checks.

## Files

- `detector.mjs`: config, lock, secrets, the read-only RPC client, delivery,
  `status.json`.
- `lib/detect.mjs`: the round. It does no I/O; the chain is injected.
- `check-pause-detector.mjs`: the CI cells (`npm run check:pause-detector`).
- `e2e-anvil.mjs`: end to end against SP's real contracts, deployed by SP's
  `DeployAnvil.s.sol` at `sp-pin.json`'s commit:
  - it raises minStake on chain;
  - it runs the alert's exact `cast send` command and confirms the operator is
    paused;
  - it checks that the next round is clear and resolves the alert.

  Run:
  `node deploy/pause-detector/e2e-anvil.mjs --sp <SP checkout at the pin, built>`.

- `config.example.json`, `io.aastar.dvt-pause-detector.plist` (`StartInterval`
  3600).

Shared with D2: `../pause-job/sp-pin.json` (ABI fragments and ROLE_* at one SP
commit, `gen-sp-pin.mjs`), `../pause-job/lib/secret-file.mjs` (the generic
secret-file reader, called with the detector's own name table) and
`../pause-job/lib/safe-error.mjs`.

## Deploy (on the Mini, after the rc.8 read-back)

1. Regenerate the pin at the rc.8 tag:
   `node deploy/pause-job/gen-sp-pin.mjs <tag commit>`, and review the diff.
2. Write `~/.aoa-pause-detector/config.json`. The addresses, implementations,
   code hashes and deploy block come from the tag read-back, never from this
   repo.
   - `logChunk` must fit the providers' `getLogs` range limits. A range that is
     too wide makes every round `unknown` until it is fixed; it never makes a
     round clear.
3. Create the secrets as 0600 files in a 0700 directory, without argv or
   history:
   - `aoa-dvt-detector-rpc-primary` and `aoa-dvt-detector-rpc-fallback` (RPC
     URLs);
   - `aoa-dvt-alert-bot-token` (the aastar-monitor bot).

   There is no keystore and no password file. The detector cannot read the D2
   keystore-password name; a cell checks this.

4. Make the state dir 0700. The state is created on the first run and is bound
   to `{chainId, spProxy, startBlock}`. A new deployment needs a new `stateDir`.
5. Render and load the plist, then check
   `launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/io.aastar.dvt-pause-detector | grep "run interval"`
   shows 3600.
6. Run `node deploy/pause-job/preflight.mjs`. It checks:
   - **launchd-on**: the detector and the price keeper are loaded; the committee
     keeper, apply-rotation and the D2 pause job are not; no other loaded job
     runs a DVT sender;
   - **pause-detector**: `status.json` is at most two intervals old.

## Before rc.8

On Sepolia today (SP 5.4.2, 11-14) `pauseUnderstakedOperator` is **not
deployed**: its eth_call reverts with empty data. The detector therefore reports
every operator `unknown`, which is the fail-closed answer. A dry run with
meaningful answers needs the rc.8 code: the anvil end to end above, or SP's rc.8
fork.
